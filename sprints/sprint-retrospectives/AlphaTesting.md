## Vision Statement

For gamers who need to manage and organize their games and find communities for games they enjoy, the Gaming Platform is a web application that will provide a single site for users to organize their game library and find new communities while doing so. The application will have a database of video games that the user can search and add to their library. This application will save gamers time and stress of keeping track of their games and progress and rating them. One feature that will help with this is users can provide their steam details and using Steam API it will search their catalog of games and add them to their list depending on if there is any playtime on them. This is not limited to just steam games, this application is planning on using igdb API to find games on all platforms. The application will also allow the user to rate and review the games, and see the top 100 games according to other users' reviews. After games have been added to the userâ€™s library the application will recommend other games to the player that are similar. This application will also allow the user to safely search the internet while preventing spoilers for their games and to find communities for the games they have played. Unlike the current organization process and competitors like MyVideoGameList our product will provide one place for users to manage their games, view recommendations, find communities, rate, review, and find new communities.

## Bug Reports

_Testers: Write your handwritten reports by following this pattern_

  

__[Bug]__ This is a good description of a bug (prefix with [Bug]) where I will tell you what the conditions were for the bug to occur and then what the failure was. Include:

  

1. Starting condition, setup or scenario

2. Steps to replicate the failure

3. Actual result

4. Expected result

5. Remarks

Most importantly: __be specific!__

  

__[Deficiency]__ Report a deficiency with this tag. A deficiency is a behavior of the application that is functionally correct (not a failure) but is deficient in some manner; or a feature or behavior that is expected but not present. This can include a feature of the website that does not meet the expectations generated by the vision statement.

  

__[Presentation]__ This is how you can report problems with the application's user interface. Is there something in the presentation that isn't clear, intuitive or an example of good UI design? Do you like the colors, fonts, layout? Does it make sense?

  

__[Recommendation]__ Give the development team a recommendation.
