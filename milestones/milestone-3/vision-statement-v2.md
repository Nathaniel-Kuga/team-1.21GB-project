# Vision Statement

1. What is it? Include 3 or so main features.

A web application that will allow gamers to manage their library of games as well as connect to other gamers. This application will allow the user to add games to lists and organize them. The app will also recommend games to players depending on games they have played previously. This application will also allow the user to use Steam API to find the games that they own on their computer and add them to lists. The user can also rate and review the game and look at the top 100 games by rating on the site. Also, the application will allow the user to safely search the internet about a game while preventing spoilers


2. What is it's purpose?

The app’s purpose is to allow gamers to connect with communities that can manage their game library no matter the platform.

3. Why are you proposing this topic?

The reason this app should be made is that a common problem for gamers is that they lose track of games they have played or beaten or have a hard time remembering games they want to play. It is also hard to connect with others about games no matter the platform.

4. Are there any competitors or existing applications that do this? If so, list them and explain why your topic is better or still worth doing.

When our team was researching this idea we could only find one of them that did a similar concept and that is MyVideoGameList. However, MyVideoGameList only keeps track of games on the list and gives you some news updates for games. Our application does more in our opinion. Our application will allow the user to organize their games, search games by category, rank the game, same search on the internet, and finally find a gaming community. Our application also allows the user to search their steam account and add games to the collection that they own.

## Vision Statement

For gamers who need to manage and organize their games and find communities for games they enjoy, the Gaming Platform is a web application that will provide a single site for users to organize their game library and find new communities while doing so. The application will have a database of video games that the user can search and add to their library. This application will save gamers time and stress of keeping track of their games and progress and rating them. One feature that will help with this is users can provide their steam details and using Steam API it will search their catalog of games and add them to their list depending on if there is any playtime on them. This is not limited to just steam games, this application is planning on using igdb API to find games on all platforms. The application will also allow the user to rate and review the games, and see the top 100 games according to other users' reviews. After games have been added to the user’s library the application will recommend other games to the player that are similar. This application will also allow the user to safely search the internet while preventing spoilers for their games and to find communities for the games they have played. Unlike the current organization process and competitors like MyVideoGameList our product will provide one place for users to manage their games, view recommendations, find communities, rate, review, and find new communities.
