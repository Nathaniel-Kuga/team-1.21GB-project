# Igdb Pricing
Igdb is free to use.

# Endpoints
The API endpoints include:
- Age rating
- Game Engine
- Genre
- Platform
- Player perspective

_**Note:**_ This is not an exhaustive list of endpoints, just some that could be used by our project.

# dotnet support
The is a open source C# [library](https://github.com/kamranayub/igdb-dotnet) available for .NET projects. 

# Limits
The api has a limit of 4 requests per second and a max of 8 requests at any moment in time so caching the responses will probably be a good idea.

# Value
Including this API will add value to our end user because it will give access to the meta data of games they add into their list. Game ratings, platform availability, and game genre are all pieces of information this api provides. This way, we are not limited to just having the game title and no extra information that can also be used for developing the game recommendations algorithm.
