# psn-api
Sony does not have a publicly available API for interacting with the Playstation Network. <font size="5">_*psn-api*_</font> is an open source API for interacting with the Playstation Network and a users "Trophies". 

# Implementation
This API Library is written in TypeScript and Javascript. After doing some research, I found that we can a use a package manager such as NPM to install this library and use it in our project.

# Value
This API will add value to the end user because if the user wants to set up the feature in their account, they will be able to see the achievements they have for the playstation games in their lists. 

# Documentation
The API has good documentation that walks a developer through the process of getting set up and using this API. It has a step by step demo of how to get a list of a users trophies by game in the user documentation.

# Cost and Terms of Use
This API is licensed under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). As such, the API is free to use. I couldn't find any information about the limit of requests, but we can email the developers and see what they are.
