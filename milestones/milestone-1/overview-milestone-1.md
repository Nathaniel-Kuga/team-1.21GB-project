### Capstone Project Ideas

1. **Store Recommender**
<br>
    We all have had that problem of trying to find a store that matches our interests or our preferences. We tend to spend some time looking at stores for items they sell or if they align with our personal preferences. This app will alleviate that problem. When the user goes to our site they can take a personality test. In this test we will ask questions like what are your hobbies, what atmosphere do you like when you go to a store and is this a place you can relax and talk to other people at? Questions like that will then be used to search online and create a list of stores that would match that quiz. This would be done using google and google maps API, it would first search the area the user gave for stores, and then it would filter the stores by using a combination of the reviews given on google and information that the store provides on google. The site could also only show stores that are open at that time so the user could even go to that store now if they wanted. Also if the user made an account on the site they could save that store on their profile and give a review of the store to remind them what they thought of it. Our team also had the plan to add a way to share their list of stores on social media like Twitter using Twitter API. It is also worth noting we think it would be an interesting feature for when the user is changing their profile picture that they could instead give an AI picture generator like DALL-E (or a similar service) a prompt and it will generate a custom profile picture for them. In our opinion, it would be something unique and fun for our site to have. In short, our site will allow the user to take a brief personality quiz and then recommend stores in the area that match their quiz results. We also believe that this can also be easily expanded upon if we want to. For example, we could expand this out to restaurants or hotels if we wanted to. The user could also look at a separate page on the site and look at the highest-rated stores in their area according to other users, like the top 20 stores in the area.

2. **Gaming Platform**
<br>
    It is a common problem for gamers to have difficulties finding communities for their games and good recommendations for new ones. This application will fix that problem. Once the user creates an account on our site they will be able to search for games and then add them to a list. This list will have some presets like played, completed, backlog, and in progress. The user can also create a list to organize their games. Once they have added some games our site can then recommend new games to them that tend to match the games they have played. We also want our app to provide communities to the user that the user then can use to reach out to other fans of the game. This could be done by using google API and also using Reddit’s API to find new forums for that player. But we will not use games in the backlog to prevent spoilers. We could also search in that user's area for community events and stores nearby they may be interested in. Later we would also be interested in making it a safe way to find information about a game and preventing spoilers. Maybe we could use YouTube and block videos that relate to the gameplay or something like that. The user could also rate the game and in a separate tab on the site could then view the top 100 games according to other users and then add them to their list if they wanted to.

3. **Task App**
<br>
    A tasks web app that uses a machine learning API to help predict the most efficient order of completing tasks based on user usage and completion data. It could function on its own or get tied into an email or browser as an extension. This app could also have users share tasks, goals, and compete to meet certain goals by a deadline. This could potentially be extended into a cross-platform mobile app using .NET MAUI. This app could also be monetized with a paid version that has more features in the future or by running ads. 

4. **Podcast Recommender App**
<br>
    The app will learn about your listening habits and will ask you questions about what you want to listen to. The website would have a built-in player so you can listen to clips of the podcast. A feature would be implemented to integrate your favorite podcasting app (like Spotify or Apple Music) account into the website so it can track what you’ve already listened to. The podcast titles would be displayed as cassette tapes.
