# Game Platform Scope

1. The ability for a person to log into our page. 

2. The user can search through a library of games.

3. The ability for users to add games to list, which have four classifications by default (backlog, finished, completed, in-progress). The user can also create a new list.

4. The platform will recommend games that the user will like depending on what is in the finished, completed, and in-progress lists, but not the backlog list.

5. The user can rate the games and leave a short review of the game for other people to see as well as themselves, they can always edit this later of course.

6. On a separate page the user can look to see the top 100 games compared to other users on the site.

7. That page would show if they have rated it and if so what their rating of that game is. 

8. If the user has games in their backlog or in-progress list it will allow a safe search on YouTube and Google, preventing potential spoilers.

9. The user has the ability to find friends and a community based on the kinds of games that they like.
